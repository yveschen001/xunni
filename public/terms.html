        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="version">Effective Date: January 18, 2025 | Version 2.1</p>

        <div class="notice-box warning">
            <strong>⚠️ LEGAL DISCLAIMER & BINDING AGREEMENT</strong><br>
            Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully. By accessing or using XunNi ("Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms. <strong>This English version shall prevail over any translations.</strong>

        <h2>1. Nature of Service: Entertainment Only</h2>
        <p>The Service provides automated fortune-telling, personality analysis, and social matching features based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and traditional astrological algorithms.</p>
        
        <div class="notice-box info">
            <strong>FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY</strong><br>
            All content, reports, predictions, and advice generated by the Service are for <strong>novelty and entertainment purposes only</strong>.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Professional Advice:</strong> The Service does not provide medical, legal, financial, or psychological advice.</li>
                <li><strong>No Reliance:</strong> You should not rely on the Service for any major life decisions (e.g., marriage, investment, health).</li>
                <li><strong>AI Limitations:</strong> AI-generated content may contain inaccuracies, errors, or "hallucinations". The Operator assumes no liability for the accuracy or reliability of such content.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Social & Matching Authorization (Implied Consent)</h2>
        <p>XunNi is a social discovery platform. By registering an account, you explicitly acknowledge and grant the following authorizations as a condition of service:</p>
        
        <h3>2.1 Unilateral Matching Consent</h3>
        <p>You authorize other users to initiate "Compatibility Analysis" or "Fortune Matching" using your public profile (Nickname/ID) and derived astrological data. This process may occur unilaterally without specific notification to you for each instance.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Data Privacy in Matching</h3>
        <p>While you consent to the matching process, we guarantee strict data privacy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Blindness:</strong> Your raw personal data (Birth Date, Time, Exact Location) is <strong>never</strong> disclosed to the matching party.</li>
            <li><strong>Result Only:</strong> The matching party receives only the derived analysis result (e.g., "85% Compatible", "Karmic Link").</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. User Conduct & Eligibility</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Eligibility</h3>

        <h3>4.2 No Refunds</h3>
